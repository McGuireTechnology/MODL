# Parking (Chapter 5)

!!! abstract "TL;DR"
    Know prohibited zones and how to set wheels on hills; practice a clear parallel parking sequence.

## Scope

Safe parking practices, prohibited locations, hill parking procedures, and visibility considerations. Verify distances (e.g., from fire hydrants, crosswalks) in official guide.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify common prohibited parking zones.
- Apply uphill/downhill parking wheel positioning.
- Execute parallel parking steps.
- Enhance vehicle visibility & safety when parked.

## 1. Prohibited Locations (Examples)

Do not park:

- In front of driveways.
- Within specified feet of fire hydrants, crosswalks, stop signs (verify numbers).
- On sidewalks or blocking pedestrian access.
- In travel lanes or double-parked.
- In designated accessible spaces without permit.

## 2. Hill Parking

</figure>

- Uphill with curb: Turn wheels away from curb; vehicle rolls slightly back into curb.
- Downhill with curb: Turn wheels toward curb; prevents forward roll.
- No curb: Turn wheels toward road edge to avoid rolling into traffic.

Set parking brake; do not rely solely on transmission.

## 3. Parallel Parking Sequence

1. Signal + position beside forward vehicle (~parallel, short gap).
2. Reverse turning toward curb, clearing rear bumper.
3. Straighten wheels, continue backing.
4. Turn opposite direction to center in space.
5. Final adjustments leaving safe distance from vehicles ahead/behind.

## 4. Visibility & Security

- Use lights in poor visibility conditions when legally required (e.g., hazard lights if disabled).
- Remove valuables from view; lock doors.
- Avoid parking in blind curves or low-visibility crests.

## Quick Self-Check

- Why turn wheels differently uphill vs downhill?
- Key parallel parking steps?
- Examples of prohibited zones?

Proceed to quiz.

## 3 things to remember

- Uphill with curb: wheels away; downhill: wheels toward curb; no curb: toward road edge.
- Common no-parking areas: hydrants, crosswalks, driveways (verify distances).
- Parallel parking: signal → reverse with angle → straighten → center → adjust.
