## Scenario / Think & Reveal

<details><summary>1. No curb, uphill parking. Wheel direction?</summary>
Turn wheels toward road edge (right) so vehicle rolls away from traffic if movement occurs.
</details>

<details><summary>2. Parallel park attempt: rear bumper aligned, turning too early. Correction?</summary>
Restart alignment; begin steering into space only once rear axle clear of front car rear bumper.
</details>

<details><summary>3. Vehicle parked on hill without parking brake. Risk?</summary>
Transmission alone may not hold; potential roll causing collision or injury.
</details>

<details><summary>4. Approaching a space near a fire hydrant; unsure distance rule. Action?</summary>
Choose another spot; verify distance requirement later; avoid potential citation.
</details>

<details><summary>5. Parallel parking space very tight. Strategy?</summary>
Use controlled incremental reverse & forward adjustments; keep wheels straight briefly before final centering.
