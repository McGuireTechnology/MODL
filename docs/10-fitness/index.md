# Be in Shape to Drive (Chapter 10)

!!! abstract "TL;DR"
    Impairment and fatigue slow reactions and judgment—check meds, plan rest, and minimize distraction overlap.

## Scope

Physical, mental, and impairment factors affecting driving: alcohol, drugs (prescription & illicit), fatigue, emotion, distraction interplay. Verify legal BAC limits and any zero-tolerance age specifics in official guide.

## Learning Objectives

- Recognize impairment types and their effects on reaction time & judgment.
- Identify fatigue signs and mitigation strategies.
- Understand medication & driving risk consultations.
- Apply distraction management techniques.

## 1. Alcohol & Drug Impairment

- Slows reaction, narrows focus, impairs judgment.
- Mixing substances compounds effects unpredictably.
- Designate driver or alternative transport before consuming.

## 2. Medication Awareness

- Review labels for drowsiness warnings.
- Consult pharmacist/doctor about combining meds and driving.
- First-dose caution: Evaluate personal reaction before driving.

## 3. Fatigue

- Signs: Yawning, drifting, delayed response, microsleeps.
- Mitigation: Adequate sleep, breaks every ~2 hours, avoid late-night long drives.

## 4. Emotional State

- Anger or stress can trigger aggressive driving.
- Strategy: Pause, deep breathing, delay trip if severely agitated.

## 5. Distraction Interplay

- Cognitive (mind off task), manual (hands off wheel), visual (eyes off road).
- Use phone only in permitted hands-free manner; avoid complex interaction.

## Quick Self-Check

- Why avoid driving on unknown first dose medication?
- Fatigue warning signs?
- Difference between visual and cognitive distraction?

Proceed to quiz.

## 3 things to remember

- Be cautious with first-dose or drowsy medications before driving.
- Fatigue signs (yawning, drifting, microsleeps) demand breaks or trip delay.
- Distraction types: visual, manual, cognitive—avoid stacking them.
