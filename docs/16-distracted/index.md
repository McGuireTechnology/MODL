# Distracted Driving (Chapter 16)

!!! abstract "TL;DR"
    Distraction comes in visual, manual, and cognitive forms—reduce device/console interaction and plan routes before driving.

## Scope

Nature of distraction (visual, manual, cognitive), common sources, mitigation tactics. Emphasize risk of device interaction and in-vehicle tasks.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify distraction types.
- Recognize high-risk behaviors.
- Apply mitigation strategies.
- Understand cumulative risk factors (fatigue + distraction).

## 1. Distraction Categories

- Visual: Eyes off road.
- Manual: Hands off controls.
- Cognitive: Mind off driving.

## 2. Common Sources

- Mobile devices (texting, browsing).
- Eating/drinking.
- Adjusting controls (navigation, audio).
- Passengers or pets.
- External events (rubbernecking).

## 3. Risk Amplifiers

- High speed.
- Adverse weather.
- Night driving.
- Fatigue or impairment.

## 4. Mitigation Strategies

- Pre-set route & audio before departure.
- Secure loose items.
- Silence non-essential notifications.
- Adopt scanning routine to maintain situational awareness.

## 5. Incident Potential

Seconds of inattention can equal football-field travel distance at highway speed; reaction time and hazard detection degrade rapidly.

## Quick Self-Check

- Examples of cognitive vs manual distraction?
- Why pre-setting navigation reduces risk?
- How fatigue compounds distraction?

Proceed to quiz.

## 3 things to remember

- Texting stacks all three distraction types—avoid while moving.
- Pre-set navigation/audio to cut mid-drive fiddling.
- Fatigue + distraction compounds risk; adjust following distance or take a break.

## Quick Review

<details><summary>Name the three distraction types.</summary>
Visual, manual, and cognitive.
</details>

<details><summary>Why pre-set navigation?</summary>
It reduces mid-drive device interaction and distraction.
</details>

<details><summary>How does fatigue interact with distraction?</summary>
It slows reaction and compounds inattention risk; take breaks and increase space.
