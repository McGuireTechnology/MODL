## Multiple Choice

<quiz>
Which comes first in the typical licensing sequence?
- [x] Vision screening
- [ ] Road test
- [ ] Insurance verification
- [ ] Parallel parking evaluation only
Vision precedes written and road tests.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Primary purpose of the vision screening is:
- [x] Verify minimum acuity & peripheral vision for safe driving
- [ ] Check color preferences
- [ ] Diagnose medical conditions comprehensively
- [ ] Adjust insurance premiums
It ensures you can safely perceive the driving environment.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Effective knowledge exam preparation emphasizes:
- [x] Active recall and spaced practice
- [ ] Only reading the guide once
- [ ] Memorizing unrelated trivia
- [ ] Ignoring missed practice questions
Recall + spacing builds durable memory.
</quiz>

<quiz>
A strong indicator of road test readiness:
- [x] Consistent mirror & shoulder checks before lane changes
- [ ] Memorizing the vehicle owner's manual
- [ ] Practicing only in empty parking lots
- [ ] Avoiding turns until test day
Observation habits prevent hazards.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Common cause of knowledge test failure:
- [x] Passive reading without self‑testing
- [ ] Using mixed practice sets
- [ ] Tracking errors and revisiting source
- [ ] Reviewing signage shapes and colors
Lack of recall practice leaves gaps.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Immediate road test disqualifier example:
- [x] Running a red light
- [ ] Taking a wide but controlled turn
- [ ] Signaling 3 seconds before a lane change
- [ ] Adjusting mirrors while parked
Safety violations end the test.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Exam anxiety can be reduced by:
- [x] Structured breathing and mock exams
- [ ] Avoiding all practice the day before
- [ ] Skipping sleep to study longer
- [ ] Hiding errors from reflection logs
Preparation + calm techniques help performance.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Primary focus of the road test observation component:
- [x] Hazard scanning, mirror checks, shoulder checks
- [ ] Engine diagnostics
- [ ] Tire pressure memorization
- [ ] Detailing interior cleanliness
Observation supports anticipation and prevention.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Best immediate step after failing the road test:
- [x] Write a specific error list and plan drills
- [ ] Schedule the earliest retest without reflection
- [ ] Blame vehicle model
- [ ] Stop practicing observation skills
Reflection directs targeted improvement.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Knowledge exam topic category:
- [x] Signs, signals, and markings
- [ ] Car audio system branding
- [ ] Personal finance management
- [ ] Engine disassembly
Core visual communication elements are tested.
</quiz>

## True / False

<quiz>
Spaced practice outperforms cramming for retention.
- [x] True
- [ ] False
Spacing strengthens long‑term recall.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Road test evaluators are unconcerned with lane positioning.
- [x] False
- [ ] True
Lane positioning is a key safety element.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Mirror + shoulder checks help detect vehicles in blind spots.
- [x] True
- [ ] False
They reveal areas mirrors alone can miss.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Running a stop sign might still pass if the rest is perfect.
- [x] False
- [ ] True
Critical safety violations typically fail instantly.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Passive reading is sufficient for top performance on knowledge exams.
- [x] False
- [ ] True
Active recall is needed for durability.
</quiz>

## Scenario / Think & Reveal

<details><summary>1. You failed due to inconsistent mirror checks. Outline a 3‑step remediation plan.</summary>
1. Drill: Perform 10 supervised lane change rehearsals verbalizing "mirror, signal, shoulder, move".
2. Habit trigger: Place a small sticky reminder near dash until behavior becomes automatic.
3. Mixed context: Practice in light traffic, then moderate traffic to generalize.
</details>

<details><summary>2. You passed vision & knowledge; schedule road test? What readiness signals must you confirm?</summary>
Consistent smooth control, reliable observation (mirrors + shoulder checks), adherence to speed & right‑of‑way, safe space management, and calm execution under mild pressure.
</details>

<details><summary>3. Anxiety spike before test — what pre‑test routine?</summary>
Sleep 7–8 hours, light meal, brief breathing exercise (4‑2‑6 pattern), quick checklist review (vehicle/legal docs), 2 low‑stakes warm‑up maneuvers nearby.
</details>

<details><summary>4. Missed several signage questions — how adjust study?</summary>
Create flashcards by shape/color/function; daily mixed recall sets; error log for each miss with exact guide paragraph reference.
</details>

<details><summary>5. Failed due to rolling stops — targeted correction?</summary>
Practice full stop drills: count "1‑2" after wheel halt at line; instructor feedback; escalate to varied intersections; integrate hazard scan before proceed.
