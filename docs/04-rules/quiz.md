</quiz>

<quiz>
Primary reason for increasing following distance in rain:
- [x] Reduced traction & longer stopping distance
- [ ] Better radio reception
- [ ] Road markings clearer
- [ ] Fuel economy improvement
Traction loss demands more buffer.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Advisory speed sign on curve indicates:

## Scenario / Think & Reveal

<details><summary>1. Heavy fog reduces visibility far below posted-limit assumptions. What should you adjust?</summary>
Reduce speed below posted, increase following distance, heighten scanning, and avoid sudden maneuvers.
</details>

<details><summary>2. Driver merges late with turn signal on and limited gap. How respond?</summary>
Create space by adjusting speed slightly; defensive yielding prevents abrupt braking.
</details>

<details><summary>3. Preparing to lane change but shoulder check reveals a fast approach. Action?</summary>
Abort maneuver; maintain lane until safe gap returns.
</details>

<details><summary>4. All-way stop: You arrive same time as vehicle to your right. What do you do?</summary>
Yield; allow right vehicle to proceed, then go when clear.
</details>

<details><summary>5. Advisory speed 35 mph on offramp; surface wet & traffic dense. Apply?</summary>
Reduce slightly below advisory; smooth deceleration; avoid abrupt steering.
