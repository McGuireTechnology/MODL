# Special Driving Conditions (Chapter 9)

!!! abstract "TL;DR"
    Slow down, increase spacing, use appropriate lighting, and make gentle inputs; know skid basics and that bridges freeze first.

## Scope

Adaptation strategies for night, rain, fog, snow/ice, and reduced traction events; skid recovery basics. Verify any recommended speed adjustments or chain/tire requirements in official guide.

## Learning Objectives

- Adjust speed, spacing, and lighting for adverse conditions.
- Apply traction management in rain, snow, ice.
- Execute basic skid recovery (steering into direction of travel).
- Recognize early hazard indicators in reduced visibility.

## 1. Night Driving

- Increase following distance.
- Use high beams when appropriate; dim for oncoming traffic.
- Heighten peripheral scanning for pedestrians or animals.

## 2. Rain & Hydroplaning Risk

</figure>

- Slow before standing water.
- Increase gap; gentle steering & braking.
- If hydroplaning: ease off accelerator, steer straight until traction returns.

## 3. Fog

- Use low beams (avoid high beam glare).
- Reduce speed; maintain larger cushion.
- Focus on road edge lines for guidance.

## 4. Snow & Ice

- Gentle inputs: accelerate/brake/steer smoothly.
- Increase following distance substantially.
- Bridges freeze first—approach cautiously.

## 5. Skid Basics

- Rear-wheel skid: Steer in direction you want front to go; avoid brakes until stability returns.
- Front-wheel skid: Ease off accelerator; steer where you want to go; allow tires to regain grip.

## Quick Self-Check

- Why low beams in fog?
- Hydroplaning response?
- Bridge surface hazard in winter?

Proceed to quiz.

## 3 things to remember

- Use low beams in fog; high beams cause glare.
- If hydroplaning: ease off accelerator and steer straight until traction returns.
- Snow/ice: gentle inputs and much larger following distances; bridges freeze first.

## Quick Flashcards

## Quick Review

<details><summary>Why low beams in fog?</summary>
High beams reflect and create glare; low beams improve visibility.
</details>

<details><summary>What to do if you hydroplane?</summary>
Ease off the accelerator and steer straight until traction returns.
</details>

<details><summary>Winter bridge hazard?</summary>
Bridges freeze first; slow and be gentle with inputs.
