## Multiple Choice

<quiz>
Hydroplaning initial response:
- [x] Ease off accelerator, steer straight
- [ ] Brake hard immediately
- [ ] Accelerate to regain traction
- [ ] Turn sharply
Gentle recovery restores grip.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Fog lighting choice:
- [x] Low beams
- [ ] High beams
- [ ] Parking lights only
- [ ] Hazard lights continuously
Low beams reduce glare.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Primary reason bridges freeze before roads:
- [x] Exposed surfaces lose heat faster
- [ ] Better insulation
- [ ] More traffic friction
- [ ] Painted lines retain cold
Exposure to air.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Night driving adaptation includes:
- [x] Increased following distance & scanning
- [ ] High beams continuously in traffic
- [ ] Reduced mirror use
- [ ] Faster speed for clear roads
Compensate for reduced visibility.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Rear-wheel skid steering:
- [x] Steer toward intended path (direction of travel)
- [ ] Steer opposite direction aggressively
- [ ] Lock brakes
- [ ] Turn hazard lights then accelerate
Align vehicle with path.
</quiz>

## True / False

<quiz>
High beams improve visibility in dense fog.
- [x] False
- [ ] True
Cause glare.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Gentle inputs help maintain traction on snow/ice.
- [x] True
- [ ] False
Sudden moves break grip.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Hydroplaning can occur at moderate speeds with sufficient water depth.
- [x] True
- [ ] False
Speed + water film lifts tires.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Skid recovery requires heavy braking first.
- [x] False
- [ ] True
Braking can worsen skid.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Increasing following distance in adverse conditions is recommended.
- [x] True
- [ ] False
More reaction time.
</quiz>

## Scenario / Think & Reveal

<details><summary>1. Light rain after dry spell—road slick. Adjustment?</summary>
Reduce speed, increase following gap, smooth inputs.
</details>

<details><summary>2. Dense fog; vehicle behind tailgating. Strategy?</summary>
Maintain safe reduced speed, increase forward gap; avoid speeding due to pressure.
</details>

<details><summary>3. Rear begins to fishtail on icy curve. Response?</summary>
Steer gently toward intended path; avoid sudden brakes.
</details>

<details><summary>4. Hydroplaning sensation (engine revs, steering light). Action?</summary>
Ease off throttle, keep steering straight, wait for traction.
</details>

<details><summary>5. Approaching bridge in freezing temps after rain. Plan?</summary>
Reduce speed before bridge, avoid sudden maneuvers.
