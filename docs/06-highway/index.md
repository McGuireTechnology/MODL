# Highway Driving (Chapter 6)

!!! abstract "TL;DR"
    Match traffic speed on entry, pass decisively, and expand time gaps—higher speeds magnify stopping distance and hazard exposure.

## Scope

Higher-speed driving strategies: merging, lane discipline, passing, speed & space management, hazard anticipation. Verify numeric speed advisories and any state-specific lane usage rules.

## Learning Objectives

- Execute safe merges and exits with proper speed matching.
- Maintain lane discipline and appropriate passing etiquette.
- Adjust following distance for higher speeds.
- Anticipate hazards earlier via extended scanning.

## 1. Merging & Entry

- Accelerate in ramp lane to match main traffic speed (when safe).
- Signal early; check mirrors & shoulder.
- Select an appropriate gap—avoid forcing merges or stopping at ramp end unless necessary.

## 2. Lane Discipline

- Keep right except when passing (verify local rule enforcement).
- Avoid frequent lane changes; they increase conflict points.
- Use center and right lanes for steady travel; left lane primarily for passing.

## 3. Passing Strategy

- Signal, check blind spots, pass promptly without exceeding safe speed.
- Re-enter lane only when you see the vehicle's front in your mirror.
- Avoid passing in limited visibility or near ramps/exits.

## 4. Speed & Space Management

- Increase time gap as speed rises; higher speed = longer stopping distance.
- Maintain a cushion ahead and to sides for escape routes.
- Adjust speed smoothly; avoid abrupt braking in dense traffic.

## 5. Extended Scanning

- Look farther ahead than city driving (multiple seconds of travel distance).
- Identify slowdowns early (brake lights, congestion patterns).
- Monitor entry ramps for merging conflicts.

## Quick Self-Check

- Why match speed when merging?
- When is a pass complete safely?
- Why expand following gap at highway speeds?

Proceed to quiz.

## 3 things to remember

- Merge by matching speed and selecting a clear gap; avoid stopping at ramp ends.
- Finish a pass when you see the passed vehicle’s front in your mirror before returning.
- Increase following distance as speed rises; smooth inputs prevent chain reactions.
