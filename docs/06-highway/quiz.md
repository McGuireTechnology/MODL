## Multiple Choice

<quiz>
Primary goal when merging from an on-ramp:
- [x] Match speed to traffic flow for smooth integration
- [ ] Stop at ramp end then accelerate
- [ ] Enter at low speed to save fuel
- [ ] Signal only after entering
Speed match reduces disruption.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Safe completion of a pass occurs when:
- [x] You can see the passed vehicle's front in your mirror
- [ ] Your rear bumper aligns with its front bumper
- [ ] You accelerate 10 mph above limit
- [ ] You drift back gradually without signaling
Mirror confirmation ensures space.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Increasing following distance at high speed primarily:
- [x] Expands reaction & braking time
- [ ] Improves audio quality
- [ ] Reduces tire wear instantly
- [ ] Prevents lane changes
More distance for hazards.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Frequent lane weaving often:
- [x] Raises collision risk
- [ ] Improves fuel economy
- [ ] Guarantees faster arrival in all cases
- [ ] Enhances tire traction
More conflict points.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Before passing you should:
- [x] Signal and check mirrors & shoulder
- [ ] Honk continuously
- [ ] Turn off headlights
- [ ] Increase gap behind
Signals + observation prevent surprises.
</quiz>

## True / False

<quiz>
Stopping at ramp end to merge is generally discouraged unless traffic forces it.
- [x] True
- [ ] False
Disrupts flow if unnecessary.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Left lane is primarily for passing where "keep right" rules apply.
- [x] True
- [ ] False
Promotes efficient flow.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Highway scanning should extend farther ahead than city driving.
- [x] True
- [ ] False
More distance = earlier hazard detection.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Re-entering lane before seeing vehicle in mirror is acceptable.
- [x] False
- [ ] True
Could cut off vehicle.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Abrupt braking is preferable to gradual deceleration for signaling slowdowns.
- [x] False
- [ ] True
Smooth decel conveys predictability.
</quiz>

## Scenario / Think & Reveal

<details><summary>1. Ramp merging: traffic dense, gap forming slowly. Strategy?</summary>
Adjust speed to align with gap, signal early, avoid stopping unless necessary.
</details>

<details><summary>2. Vehicle tailgating you at posted speed. Options?</summary>
Maintain speed, increase forward gap, change lanes when safe to let tailgater pass.
</details>

<details><summary>3. Passing attempt: oncoming lane view limited by curve. Action?</summary>
Delay pass until full sight distance; safety overrides speed.
</details>

<details><summary>4. Spot congestion forming ahead (brake lights). What early adjustments?</summary>
Ease off throttle, increase gap, communicate with gentle braking if needed.
</details>

<details><summary>5. After pass, you see vehicle's headlights in mirror but space tight. What do you do?</summary>
Wait to widen gap further before signaling and returning.
