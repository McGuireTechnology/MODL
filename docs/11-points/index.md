# Point System (Chapter 11)

!!! abstract "TL;DR"
    Points add up from violations and can trigger suspensions and premium hikes—prevention is safer (and cheaper) than remediation.

## Scope

Consequences of accumulating violation points: thresholds, license actions, prevention strategies. Verify exact point values and suspension intervals in official guide.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand point assignment concept.
- Recognize cumulative impact on licensing status.
- Identify prevention strategies through safe habits.
- Respond appropriately after receiving points.

## 1. Point Assignment Basics

Violations add points; serious offenses add more. Accumulation over specified periods can trigger suspension or revocation (verify numeric thresholds).

## 2. Consequences

- Insurance premium increases.
- Administrative actions (warning, suspension, revocation).
- Mandatory driver improvement programs possible.

## 3. Tracking & Prevention

- Periodically review driving record.
- Maintain defensive habits; avoid aggressive speeding or risky maneuvers.
- Address mechanical issues (e.g., lights) to prevent fixable violations.

## 4. After Receiving Points

- Analyze root cause (speeding, distraction, etc.).
- Implement corrective plan: Adjust commute timing, reduce phone interaction, enhance scanning.
- Consider education resources.

## Quick Self-Check

- Why review record periodically?
- Prevention strategies to avoid common point violations?
- Impact of points on insurance?
