# Study Guide: Modes + Tips

This one-stop page combines reader-friendly study modes with practical strategies. Start with the quick setup, try 1–2 modes, then layer in tips that stick.

---

## Quick Start

- Turn on the Reader Tools (gear button) to adjust font, spacing, and contrast.
- Use short sessions: 20 minutes study, 5 minutes break.
- Start each page with the TL;DR, then take the quiz.
- Aim for progress, not perfection—small wins count.

## Modes You Can Try

- Minimal View: Collapse details sections first; expand only what you need.
- Audio Read-Along: Read out loud or use your device’s TTS. Later we’ll add audio clips here.
- Recall First: Before scrolling, write 2–3 things you already know about the topic.
- Flashcards: Turn “Key Points” into quick Q→A cards.

## Routines That Help

- Pre-commit: “I’ll finish the quiz on this page.”
- Put your phone in Do Not Disturb while studying.
- Keep water nearby; stand up during breaks.
- If stuck, skip ahead and return later.

## When Focus Slips

- Switch modes: from reading → quiz → flashcards.
- Use the TL;DR and “3 things to remember” to reset.
- Remove friction: increase font size, spacing, and contrast.

## Motivation

- Watch your progress bar grow—chapters marked as viewed count toward completion.
- Celebrate streaks—two days in a row is great.

Tip: If you only remember three things from a page, that’s a win.

## Suggested 7-Day Plan

Day 1: Chapters 1–2

Day 2: Chapters 3–4

Day 3: Chapters 5–6

Day 4: Chapters 7–8

Day 5: Chapters 9–10

Day 6: Full practice exam + targeted review

Day 7: Light recap; rest & sleep

## Active Recall & Spaced Repetition

Read a subsection; close the page; list 3 key points from memory. Reopen and verify. Repeat later the same day briefly for spacing.

## Mnemonics Examples

- Sign colors: "Red = Restrict, Yellow = Caution, Green = Go Info, Blue = Services, Brown = Recreation/History." (Confirm exact categories.)
- Right-of-way caution: "Yield when in doubt—safety outruns pride." (Mindset, not statutory language.)

## Common Pitfalls

- Memorizing without context → weak retention.
- Ignoring wrong quiz answers → repeated errors.
- Cramming night before → fatigue reduces recall.

## Exam Day Checklist

- Valid permit/license & required identification.
- Adequate rest (7–8 hours prior night).
- Hydrate lightly; avoid heavy meal right before.
- Arrive early to reduce stress.

## Mindset

Aim for comprehension over rote. Ask: "If this rule vanished, what hazard would increase?" Linking rules to risk makes them stick.

## Tracking Weak Areas

Maintain a simple tally sheet: columns for chapters; increment when you miss a question. Focus final review where counts are highest.

## Final Reminder

Always cross-check any numeric limits (distances, BAC thresholds, point triggers) with the official Missouri Driver Guide before the real exam.
