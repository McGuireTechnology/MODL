# Signs, Signals & Markings (Chapter 3)

!!! abstract "TL;DR"
    Read shape + color first to infer intent, then confirm with text/symbol. Pavement lines govern where you may travel or pass—solid means hold, broken allows change when safe.

## Scope

Shapes, colors, and pavement markings that communicate regulatory, warning, and guidance information. Verify color or marking specifics (e.g., lane line meanings) in official guide.

## Learning Objectives

- Interpret sign shape & color at a glance.
- Distinguish regulatory vs warning vs guide signage.
- Apply pavement marking meanings to lane positioning & passing.
- Recognize signal indications & lane control arrows.

## 1. Sign Shape

Shape signals intent before text. Catalog:

| Shape | Icon | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| Octagon | ![Octagon](../assets/images/signs/shapes/octagon.svg) | Stop |
| Triangle (down) | ![Triangle](../assets/images/signs/shapes/triangle.svg) | Yield |
| Diamond | ![Diamond](../assets/images/signs/shapes/diamond.svg) | Warning / hazard ahead |
| Rectangle (vertical) | ![Vertical Rectangle](../assets/images/signs/shapes/vertical-rectangle.svg) | Regulatory |
| Rectangle (horizontal) | ![Horizontal Rectangle](../assets/images/signs/shapes/horizontal-rectangle.svg) | Guide / info |

| Pennant | ![Pennant](../assets/images/signs/shapes/pennant.svg) | No passing zone |

## 2. Sign Colors

Color sets tone (prohibit vs warn vs guide). Catalog:

| Color | Swatch | General Meaning | Typical Examples |
|-------|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Red | ![Red](../assets/images/signs/colors/red.svg) | Stop / Yield / Prohibited | STOP, DO NOT ENTER, WRONG WAY |
| Yellow | ![Yellow](../assets/images/signs/colors/yellow.svg) | General Warning | Curve ahead, Merge area |
| Orange | ![Orange](../assets/images/signs/colors/orange.svg) | Temporary Work Zone | Road work ahead, Detour |
| Black | ![Black](../assets/images/signs/colors/black.svg) | Regulatory (text/symbol) | Speed numerals, lane control text |
| White | ![White](../assets/images/signs/colors/white.svg) | Regulatory background | Speed limit, One Way |
| Fluorescent Yellow-Green | ![Yellow-Green](../assets/images/signs/colors/yellow-green.svg) | School / Ped / Bike emphasis | School crossing, Pedestrian ahead |
| Green | ![Green](../assets/images/signs/colors/green.svg) | Direction / Guidance | Exit signs, mileage/distance |

## 3. Pavement Markings

| Marking | Icon | Meaning | Driver Action |
|---------|------|---------|---------------|
| Solid Center Line | ![Solid](../assets/images/markings/solid-line.svg) | Separates opposing traffic; no passing where solid on your side | Stay in lane; do not initiate pass |
| Broken Center Line | ![Broken](../assets/images/markings/broken-line.svg) | Passing permitted when clear | Signal, check gap, pass safely |
| Double Solid Yellow | ![Double Yellow](../assets/images/markings/double-solid-yellow.svg) | No passing either direction | Do not cross except turning left into/ out of driveway |
| White Lane Line (Same Direction) | ![White](../assets/images/markings/white-lane-line.svg) | Separates lanes moving same direction | Solid = hold lane; broken = may change when safe |
| Lane Arrow | ![Arrow](../assets/images/markings/arrow.svg) | Permitted turn / movement from lane | Commit to shown movement; position early |
| Crosswalk | ![Crosswalk](../assets/images/markings/crosswalk.svg) | Pedestrian crossing zone | Yield to pedestrians; stop before markings |
| Stop Line | ![Stop Line](../assets/images/markings/stop-line.svg) | Legal stopping point at sign/signal | Stop before line; then proceed when allowed |
| Center Left-Turn Lane (3-lane) | ![Center Turn](../assets/images/markings/center-turn-lane.svg) | Shared lane for left turns from either direction; marked with double broken yellow and arrows | May use to turn left; yield to oncoming traffic; don't use for through travel |
| Divided Highway (4-lane) | ![Divided](../assets/images/markings/divided-highway.svg) | Physical median separates opposing directions; typically higher speed limit | Stay in proper direction lanes; no crossing median; obey posted speed |

## 4. Signals & Lane Control

| Indication | Icon | Meaning | Driver Action |
|------------|------|---------|---------------|
| Steady Red | ![Red](../assets/images/signals/steady-red.svg) | Stop | Full stop; turn right on red only if permitted |
| Steady Yellow | ![Yellow](../assets/images/signals/steady-yellow.svg) | Transition (about to change to red) | Prepare to stop if safe; clear intersection if already in |
| Steady Green | ![Green](../assets/images/signals/steady-green.svg) | Proceed | Go if intersection clear; yield to pedestrians/turning conflicts |
| Flashing Red | ![Flashing Red](../assets/images/signals/flashing-red.svg) | All-way stop | Treat as stop sign; yield to traffic that arrived first |
| Flashing Yellow | ![Flashing Yellow](../assets/images/signals/flashing-yellow.svg) | Caution; slower speed | Cover brake; proceed carefully |

| Lane Control | Icon | Meaning | Action |
|-------------|------|---------|--------|
| Green Arrow | → | Lane open for movement shown | Use lane for indicated movement |
| Red X | ✕ | Lane closed | Do not use lane; merge away |
| Yellow Arrow / X | ! | Transition (soon to change) | Prepare to vacate lane safely |

### Left-Turn Signal Types Evolution

Modern flashing yellow arrow (FYA) heads replace traditional "doghouse" clusters. They give a clearer distinction between protected (green arrow) and permissive (flashing yellow arrow) phases and reduce driver confusion with circular greens.

| Type | Icon | Phases Provided | Notes |
|------|------|-----------------|-------|
| Traditional Doghouse 5-Section | ![Doghouse](../assets/images/signals/doghouse-5-section.svg) | • Red (stop)<br>• Green circle + Green arrow (protected left)<br>• Yellow circle + Yellow arrow (clearance)<br>• Green circle (permissive left, yield to oncoming)<br>• Yellow circle (clearance) | Left turn only; typically has sign "Green Ball Yield to Oncoming Traffic" |
| Vertical 5-Head Protected/Permissive | ![Vertical 5](../assets/images/signals/left-turn-5-head.svg) | • Red (stop)<br>• Red + Green arrow (protected left)<br>• Red + Yellow arrow (clearance)<br>• Green circle (permissive left + through)<br>• Yellow circle (clearance) | Saves lateral space; still uses circular permissive green |
| 4-Section FYA Arrow Head | ![FYA 4](../assets/images/signals/flashing-yellow-4-section.svg) | • Red arrow (stop)<br>• Green arrow (protected left)<br>• Steady yellow arrow (clearance)<br>• Flashing yellow arrow (permissive left) | Distinct flashing arrow conveys yield to opposing traffic |
| 3-Section FYA Arrow Head | ![FYA 3](../assets/images/signals/flashing-yellow-3-section.svg) | • Red arrow (stop)<br>• Green arrow (protected left)<br>• Flashing yellow arrow (permissive left) | Combines clearance into transition flash timing; used where simpler sequencing sufficient |
| Protected-Only 3-Head | ![Protected 3](../assets/images/signals/left-turn-3-head.svg) | • Red arrow (stop)<br>• Green arrow (protected left)<br>• Yellow arrow (clearance) | All arrows; never yield on flashing yellow because none provided |

Phase logic summary:

- Green Arrow: Protected turn; opposing and pedestrian conflicts held.
- Flashing Yellow Arrow: Permissive turn; yield to opposing traffic & pedestrians, then complete turn when gap exists.
- Steady Yellow Arrow: Prepare to stop; protected phase ending.
- Red Arrow: Stop—no turn allowed.

## 5. Work Zones & Temporary Control

| Element | Icon | Purpose | Driver Action |
|---------|------|---------|---------------|
| Cone | ![Cone](../assets/images/work-zone/cone.svg) | Channelizes traffic; indicates taper | Reduce speed; stay within designated path |
| Orange Diamond Sign | ![Orange Sign](../assets/images/work-zone/orange-sign.svg) | Warns of work zone condition | Read message early; adjust speed/position |
| Arrow Board | ![Arrow Board](../assets/images/work-zone/arrow-board.svg) | Directs merge or lane shift | Merge promptly and smoothly |
| Flagger / Paddle | ![Flagger](../assets/images/work-zone/flagger.svg) | Provides hand/paddle control | Obey flagger instructions immediately |
| Barrier | ![Barrier](../assets/images/work-zone/barrier.svg) | Separates workers and traffic | Do not drive behind barriers; maintain buffer |

Slow early, increase following distance, and expect sudden stops or workers close to the lane edge.

## Quick Self-Check

- What does a pentagon shape suggest?
- Difference between solid and broken white lane lines?
- Meaning of a flashing yellow signal?

Proceed to quiz when confident.

## 3 things to remember

- Shape + color are fast clues (e.g., octagon = stop; yellow = warning).
- Lane lines: solid = maintain lane; broken = lane change or passing when safe.
- Flashing red = stop; flashing yellow = caution.
