# Everyday Driving Tips (Chapter 8)

!!! abstract "TL;DR"
    Scan widely, signal early, keep space cushions, and drive predictably to reduce surprises for everyone.

## Scope

Routine safety habits: scanning, signaling, space cushions, courtesy interaction, hazard anticipation.

## Learning Objectives

- Build consistent mirror & shoulder check habits.
- Maintain space cushions around vehicle.
- Apply proactive hazard anticipation.
- Practice courtesy to reduce unpredictable maneuvers.

## 1. Scanning & Observation

Systematic glance pattern: front, mirrors, instrument cluster, blind spots when needed. Look several seconds ahead; identify potential conflicts early.

## 2. Signaling Discipline

Signal before braking or lateral movement; maintain signal through maneuver; cancel promptly.

## 3. Space Cushions

Keep time-based following gap; adjust lateral position to avoid clustering. Maintain escape route to one side.

## 4. Courtesy & Predictability

Yield voluntarily to defuse aggressive merges; avoid abrupt lane changes; use calm, consistent pacing.

## 5. Hazard Anticipation

Watch for door openings, sudden stops, pedestrians stepping between parked cars, turning vehicles without signals.

## Quick Self-Check

- What comprises a robust scan cycle?
- Why maintain an escape route?
- When to activate turn signal?

Proceed to quiz.

## 3 things to remember

- Use a repeatable scan cycle (front → mirrors → gauges → sides/blind spots when needed).
- Keep an escape route; don’t get boxed in.
- Signal before braking or moving laterally; cancel promptly after.
