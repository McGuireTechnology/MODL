# License Basics (Chapter 1)

!!! abstract "TL;DR"
    Missouri Class F in one line: know the GDL stages, bring ID/SSN/residency proofs, and follow the vision > knowledge > road test path—always confirm exact ages and limits in the official guide.

## What this chapter covers

Overview of Missouri Class F (non-commercial) driver licensing: who is eligible, how Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) works, which documents you need, and your responsibilities to keep your license valid.

## Learning objectives

- Differentiate permit, intermediate, and full license stages (GDL) and their purposes.
- Identify required proofs (identity/legal presence, Social Security number, Missouri residency).
- Describe the vision, knowledge, and road testing sequence at a high level.
- Explain renewal basics and when you must report name or address changes.

!!! note "Verify official specifics"
    Numeric details (ages, timeframes, passenger limits, time-of-night restrictions, renewal periods, and distances) can change. Always verify the latest Missouri Driver Guide for exact values.

## 1. Class F overview

Class F is Missouri’s standard non-commercial license for operating typical passenger cars and light trucks. It does not authorize commercial driving (CDL) or motorcycle operation unless properly endorsed.

Key ideas:

- It’s a privilege granted by the state, conditioned on knowledge, skill, and safe conduct.
- Operation requires current, valid licensing; driving on an expired, suspended, or revoked license can lead to points and further sanctions.

## 2. Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL)

GDL phases let new drivers gain experience in lower-risk steps before full privileges. Missouri's structure (verify specifics in the official guide) generally includes:

1. Instruction permit
    - Supervised driving only with a qualified, properly licensed adult in the front seat.
    - May include passenger and nighttime limits intended to reduce exposure to high‑risk conditions.
2. Intermediate license
    - Allows unsupervised driving with specific limitations (for example, nighttime driving windows and passenger count rules for younger drivers—verify details).
    - Clean driving history for a minimum period is typically required to progress.
3. Full license
    - Graduated restrictions lift once age, time, and incident‑free criteria are met.

Why this matters:

- Crash risk is highest early in licensure; restrictions target the riskiest conditions (night driving, multiple teen passengers) to improve outcomes.

## 3. Documents and identification

Expect to provide original or certified documentation in the following categories:

- Identity and lawful presence (e.g., birth certificate or passport; verify accepted forms).
- Social Security number (card or acceptable proof).
- Missouri residency (usually two documents such as utility bill, bank statement, or lease).

Tips to avoid delays:

- Names must match across documents; fix mismatches with the issuing agency first.
- Bring recent, legible documents. Electronic proofs may be allowed in some cases—verify.

### REAL ID note

Missouri issues both REAL ID‑compliant and non‑REAL ID credentials. Review the state’s REAL ID guidance to decide which you need for federal facility/air travel purposes.

## 4. Testing sequence (high level)

You'll typically complete:

1. Vision screening
    - Confirms minimum acuity and peripheral awareness for safe driving.
2. Knowledge exam
    - Multiple‑choice rules-of-the-road, signage, and safe driving practices.
3. Road test
    - Demonstrates basic control, observation, signaling, and compliance with law.

Note: Chapter 2 ("Exam Process") covers test logistics and readiness in greater detail.

## 5. Validity, renewal, and changes

- Renewal periods can vary by age category. Check your credential’s expiration date and renew ahead of time.
- You must update the state after a legal name change or change of address within the required timeframe.
- Keep your license accessible while driving; some interactions, like traffic stops or crashes, require you to present it.

Consequences of lapses:

- Driving after expiration or during a suspension/revocation can lead to citations, points, and insurance/record impacts.

## 6. Responsibilities and safe conduct

Licensing signals minimum competence, not perfection. Ongoing responsibilities include:

- Drive sober and alert; never drive impaired by alcohol, drugs, or fatigue.
- Maintain financial responsibility (insurance) and legal registration of your vehicle.
- Model courteous, predictable behavior—signal early, yield appropriately, and manage space.

---

## 7. Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

- Incomplete documentation → Use a printed checklist and verify acceptable forms on the state site.
- Name/address mismatches → Resolve with SSA and issuing agencies before your visit.
- Overlooking GDL limits → Post a reminder card in the vehicle; set phone alerts for time windows.
- Studying passively → Use active recall (cover the page, list key points, check, repeat).

## Quick self‑check

- Which GDL stage still requires supervision? What are typical goals of its restrictions?
- Which document categories must you bring? What happens if your name differs across them?
- What are the three testing components and their purposes?

Proceed to the Chapter 1 Quiz when you can answer these confidently.

## 3 things to remember

- GDL stages build experience safely before full privileges; know each stage’s limits.
- Bring identity, SSN, and Missouri residency proofs that match across documents.
- The sequence is vision → knowledge → road; prepare actively, not passively.
