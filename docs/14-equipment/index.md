# Vehicle Equipment & Inspections (Chapter 14)

!!! abstract "TL;DR"
    Keep lights, tires, brakes, mirrors, and wipers in working order—routine checks prevent tickets and crashes.

## Scope

Fundamental safety equipment, inspection considerations, maintenance habits. Verify any state-specific inspection or emissions requirements.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify critical safety equipment.
- Understand purpose of inspections.
- Recognize maintenance as prevention.
- Know implications of operating with unsafe equipment.

## 1. Critical Safety Equipment

- Brakes.
- Lights & signals.
- Tires (tread, inflation).
- Mirrors & windshield (clear visibility).
- Horn (audible warning).

## 2. Inspections & Compliance

Inspections validate roadworthiness; ensure emission, safety compliance where mandated.

## 3. Maintenance & Prevention

- Routine checks reduce breakdown risk.
- Early detection avoids violations.
- Tire pressure, fluid levels, lighting checks recommended.

## 4. Unsafe Operation Consequences

- Citations or fines.
- Increased crash risk.
- Liability escalation if negligence proven.

## 5. Pre-Trip Quick Checklist (Sample)

- Lights functioning? (Head, tail, brake, turn)
- Tire inflation adequate?
- Windshield clear? Wipers functional?
- Mirrors adjusted?
- No obvious leaks?

## Quick Self-Check

- Why inspect lights regularly?
- How does maintenance prevent violations?
- What risks follow tire neglect?

Proceed to quiz.

## 3 things to remember

- Replace failed bulbs promptly; brake lights are critical for rear visibility.
- Maintain tire pressure/tread; low grip harms handling and braking.
- Investigate dashboard warnings instead of ignoring them.
